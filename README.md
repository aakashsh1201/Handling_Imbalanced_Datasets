# Handle-Imbalanced-Dataset
> Class Imbalance is a common problem in machine learning, especially in classification problems. 
> Imbalance data can hamper our model accuracy big time. 
> We notice that having a balanced data set for a model would generate higher accuracy models, higher balanced accuracy and balanced detection rate. 
> Hence, its important to have a balanced data set for a classification model.
